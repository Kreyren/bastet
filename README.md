# Bastet
### What it Bastet?
Bastet is a very simple and basic shell script to control emerge.

### Why?
Why not?. But for real: Because `bastet insall larry` makes more sense then `emerge -av larry`. It's really just because i got bored and wanted a more straightforward way of using emerge so that i simply can do `install`, `uninstall`, `search` etc. instead doing it with `-` and `--` arguments.

### Is this going to get more advanced?
Maybe. I'm planning to learn more about shell scripts and who knows? maybe i'll make Bastet a fully fledged project one day. it serves as testing ground for now for me to learn more about shell and just to play around with it a bit.

### God that code is garbage
Yes but to be quite honest here: i don't care
